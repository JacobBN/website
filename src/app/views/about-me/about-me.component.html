              Hello, I'm Jacob B. NÃ¸rgaard.
            </p>
            <p>
              I'm originally from Denmark, but moved to the United States to be with my wife, Melanie, who's from Texas. 
              We have a wonderful toddler son, who's full of energy.
            </p>
            <p>
              As a software engineer, I've worked in agile environments to build solid and well tested products 
              for various stakeholders. I love learning and using my competencies in problem solving, cloud technology 
              (like Azure), and software such as Node.js, C#, and front-end frameworks like Vue.js.
            </p>
            <p>
              I'm also passionate about software architecture and design patterns. Just as a good team can do 
              much more than an individual, a well-architected solution rather than localized bandaid-solutions 
              is key to solid software that's testable, maintainable, and scalable.
            </p>
